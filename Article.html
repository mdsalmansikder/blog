            <h3>Sea buckthorn. Elderberry. Fermented rye bread. Pickled cherries. Salt-baked beets. These ingredients,
                which sound like they could be from a Dr. Seuss children’s book, pepper the menus of the new breed of
                Nordic restaurants.</h3>
            <p>The modern wave of Scandinavian cuisine takes a unique, minimalist approach, increasingly moving far
                beyond the signature, well-known dishes of the region like Swedish meatballs. In part, thanks to the
                massive influence of René Redzepi's game-changing Copenhagen restaurant Noma, which is closing after a
                13-year run, chefs around the U.S. are offering their takes on simple but incredibly flavorful dishes
                that are made with Nordic ingredients while also emphasizing what's local, fresh, and seasonal. It's the
                "New Nordic," and it's all about purity.</p>
            <h3>Aska from Fredrik Berselius</h3>
            <p>
                There are two options for enjoying Aska, the critically acclaimed Brooklyn restaurant from young,
                ambitious chef Fredrik Berselius: Reserve months in advance for a mind-blowing tasting menu experience,
                and be prepared to eat some unusual sea dwellers, dehydrated organs, and things like moss; or, simply
                pop in, head downstairs to the casual Edda bar, and enjoy cocktails featuring aquavit, a glass of
                natural wine, and one of the delicious snacks on offer. Don’t miss the Swedish pancake, a light crepe
                topped with salted beef, farmers’ cheese, and dill—it’s perfect for sharing with a friend.</p>
            <h4>“We like things to be simple, not covered up. The atmosphere is pared down, with no distractions, and a
                sense of straightforwardness.”</h4>
            <p>Of course, there's also the notion of hygge, a concept that's sweeping the U.S. alongside the spreading
                Noma effect. Pronounced "hoo-gah," the best translation would be "cozy." As Pernille Folkersen,
                sommelier and manager at N'eat, a recently opened Nordic restaurant in New York's East Village, puts it,
                "Minimum rules, no tablecloths, make people feel welcome-it's feeling relaxed and comfortable." Her
                native Denmark is ranked as the number one happiest country in the world, and Pernille credits the
                culture of hygge: "When we're feeling overwhelmed by life, we just say, 'Oh well, we'll be hygge."</p>
            <p>This à la carte-only downtown Manhattan restaurant is true hygge; you'll feel right at home, whether
                you're just enjoying some snacks-to be eaten with fingers-or some of the heartier dishes, like the
                boneless short rib with fermented cherry sauce.</p>
            <img src="/tasting/img/restu2.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>The Willows Inn</h3>
            <p>Honoring Minnesota's Scandinavian immigrant heritage, this restaurant in a historic, restored warehouse
                in Minneapolis focuses on locally sourced ingredients while employing traditional techniques of Nordic
                cooking: smoking, salt-curing, and confit root vegetables, as some examples. A truly stellar wine list
                and relaxed atmosphere round out the experience. Make your weekend with the Sunday Supper three-course
                meal here, only $36 per person.</p>
            <p>You wouldn't know you're inside Grand Central Station at this beautifully designed restaurant from Claus
                Meyer (who financed Noma) where hygge reigns, natural wine and aquavit (Scandinavian eau-de-vie)
                cocktails flow, and Icelandic chef Gunnar Gíslason offers both à la carte and tasting menu options
                (including a vegetarian version). Agern boasts Nordic staples like salt- and ash-baked root vegetables
                and arctic char with skyr yogurt sauce; the savory-leaning desserts are absolutely worth saving room
                for.</p>
            <h4>“Minimum rules, no tablecloths, make people feel welcome, it's feeling relaxed and comfortable.”</h4>
            <p>This highly acclaimed restaurant on a remote island north of Seattle is where young chef and Noma alum
                Blaine Wetzel made his name serving an ambitious tasting menu featuring local delights of the sea, wild
                herbs, and fresh farm greens, and otherwise employing the Redzepi approach to ingredient sourcing. It's
                tasting-menu-only, and should be reserved well in advance. Enjoy the view.</p>
